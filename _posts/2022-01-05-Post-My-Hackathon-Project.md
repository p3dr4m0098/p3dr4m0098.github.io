title: My Hackathon Project
---
## This is my Hackathon project which I've deployed using the Django framework.

At first, I wanted to make a website that identifies songs for you and brings them up, but when I did some research about it and thought a bit more on it, I realised that I don't have neither the skill nor the knowledge to carry it out, YET.

That's why I decided to only do the basic parts of it for now, like showing a list of all the songs on the website, or showing a list of the songs that belong to one specific artist, or the ones that fit into a single genre, all of which are sorted by the number of likes each song has got. Yeah, you heard that right; you can like or dislike songs on the website, too. It also has a section in which you can suggest any song you like.


But the question is: "Will I ever complete this journey that I've taken on?".

My answer to that is that I hope so. I was eager for it when I first thought of it, and I still am; I hope I don't lose it in oblivion, and I believe I shall try my best to remember it. But the thing is that I should wait to see what life brings me, I might walk my way into AI, and I might not. If I know one thing for sure, that's the fact that if I ever get to learn how to process audio files, I will come back to this and make something truly fantastic out of it. **So if you are interested, make sure you stay tuned.**
